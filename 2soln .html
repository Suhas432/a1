In HTML, comments serve the purpose of providing non-executable annotations within the code. They are used to include information, explanations, or notes that are meant for developers or anyone reading the code but are not displayed in the rendered web page. Comments in HTML are ignored by web browsers during page rendering.

The syntax for comments in HTML is to enclose the comment content between <!-- and -->. Everything between these markers will be treated as a comment.

Here's an example of how to use comments in an HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Comments Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- This is a comment. It will not be displayed on the webpage. -->

    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    
    <!-- The following paragraph provides additional information -->
    <p>This is a sample HTML document with comments. Comments are useful for documenting your code.</p>

    <!-- You can also use comments to temporarily disable or "comment out" code:
    <p>This paragraph is commented out and won't be displayed.</p>
    -->

    <p>Feel free to explore the content of this page!</p>
</body>
</html>



In this example:

The first comment provides a general note.
The second comment explains the purpose of the paragraph.
The third comment demonstrates how you can use comments to disable or "comment out" specific lines or blocks of code temporarily.
Comments are valuable for improving code readability, collaboration among developers, and providing context or documentation for complex sections of code. However, it's essential not to overuse comments or rely on them excessively, as clear and self-explanatory code is generally preferable.
